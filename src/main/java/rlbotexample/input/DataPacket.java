 * This class is here for your convenience, it is NOT part of the framework. You can change it as much
 * as you want, or delete it. The benefits of using this instead of rlbot.flat.GameTickPacket are:
 * 1. You end up with nice custom Vector3 objects that you can call methods on.
 * 2. If the framework changes its data format, you can just update the code here
 * and leave your bot logic alone.
